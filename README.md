# PMOD™ Intermediary - Monitoring and debugging PMOD™s

## Overview

Our PMOD™ intermediary board is designed for monitoring and debugging purposes, allowing users to monitor all signals of a 12-pin PMOD™ connector. 
With this board, debugging connection problems with an existing PMOD™ extension board becomes an easy task. 
A green LED, which is integrated into the board, provides a quick and easy way to check the presence of the supply voltage (VCC).

In addition, the board enables users to measure the actual current consumption.
This can be done by either adding an ampere meter in series or measuring the voltage drop across the integrated shunt resistors. 

Each power and ground line of the 12-pin PMOD™ connector can be individually measured.

The size and pinout of our PMOD™ intermediary board follow the Digilent Pmod™ Interface Specification, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices. With this board, users can easily monitor and debug PMOD™ devices without the need for additional hardware or complex set-ups.

## Current measurement

Do you know how much current your PMOD™ consumes?

### Average current using an amper meter

### Dynamic current using shunt resistor

## External supply voltage
